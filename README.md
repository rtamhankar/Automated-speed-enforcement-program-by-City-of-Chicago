## Introduction

In the "Making_Of" document, three aspects of the data are represented with the help of insights on the data and they have been visualized using different charts. The insights on the dataset support Automated Speed Enforcement program by displaying the visualizations which show that reduction in the number of violations over the years is a result of 'Automated Speed Enforcement' program.

In the revised document, the changes done in the visualizations have been incorporated.
